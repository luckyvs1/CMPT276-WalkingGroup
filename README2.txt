Notes:

1. To view the profile of users you monitor or are monitored by click on the user after navigating through the monitor button on the dashboard
2. Proxy Builder toast messages have been turned off, but the log information is still available
3. My groups only shows ‘my’ groups and not those of my ‘children’ that I’m not in
4. Tracker activity is only enabled if you are a parent (i.e. monitor an individual) and can be accessed on the dashboard
5. Unread messages are bold; and read are lighter
6. Emergency messages have read chat bubbles and normal messages are blue/white
7. When you arrive at the destination location; there is a message in the Logcat to indicate such
8. My groups is where the user would start their walk by clicking the walk button (and this makes this group active).
