# Walking Group

Android application which allows users to create or join a walking group. This application is inspired by the walking school bus campaign: http://www.walkingschoolbus.org and this project was completed as part of Introduction to Software Engineering at SFU as a group of 4. 

## Features

- User authentication using JWT's
- Utilizes Google Maps API for viewing walking groups
- Leaderboard for gamification with unlockable items in the shop based on tier
- Alert messaging as part of a panic button to notify members who monitor the user (parents/walking group leader)

### Notes

- For testing it is recommended to use a phone for optimized performance (issue only on adding and removing users if the list is large)
