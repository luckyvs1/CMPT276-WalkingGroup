Points Reward Structure:
User gains points by completing walks the point reward scheme is almost 1 meter per 1 point
The reward scheme was selected based on a user walking up to approximately 2km to and back from school so a total of 4km per day (it will take approx 88 days to reach max tier)
The user will gain the first reward tier at 4000 points (4km)
The user will gain a colorful title and 3 avatar icons per tier
The tier structure follows a Fibonacci sequence
Suppose F[] contains the generated Fibonacci sequence (F[] = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...}).  Tier 0 is 0 points. Points need for Tier j ( 1 <= j <= numTiers)  is determined by 4000 * F[j]
1st Tier 4000
2nd Tier 8000
3rd Tier 12000
...
This scheme will give the user a gradual increase in difficulty and keep them motivated to unlock all 10 tiers (currently, but more to come in the future). The scheme is easily expandable on in order to add more tiers in the future.
